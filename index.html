      I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so,
      in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny‚Äôs worth.

      ‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make a
      transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
      for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
      The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
      the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù

      Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and
    learning from their experiences was easy.

      ‚Äú The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program
    gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
    junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from
    an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ‚Äù

      ‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
    professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
    student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
    did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
    project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
    could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
    experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
    100% recommend! ‚Äù
